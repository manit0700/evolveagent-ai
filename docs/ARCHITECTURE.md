# EvolveAgent AI — Architecture

EvolveAgent AI is a local-first, workspace-aware multi-agent AI operating system built with FastAPI, React, real LLM integrations, JSON-based storage, and governed automation.

This document collects the system's architecture diagrams. All diagrams use Mermaid and render directly in GitHub markdown.

## 1. High-Level System Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[User / File / Recording / Linear / Workspace Input] --> B[Master Orchestrator Agent]
    B --> C[Specialist Agents + Tools]
    C --> D[Governance + Permission Layer]
    D --> E[LLM / File / Recording / Automation Workflow]
    E --> F[Judge Agent + Evaluation Lab]
    F --> G[Memory + Analytics + Learning]
    G --> H[Final Answer / Project Update / Export / Report]
```

The Master Orchestrator Agent classifies each request, routes it through the correct workflow, coordinates specialist agents under the governance layer, evaluates the result, stores memory and analytics, and returns one clean response. Simple Mode shows only the answer; Developer Mode exposes every layer.

## 2. Agent Workflow Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    IN[Request + Workspace Context] --> DET[Task Type Detection]

    DET -->|Text| RES[Research Agent]
    DET -->|File| FILE[File Analysis Agent]
    DET -->|Recording| REC[Recording Analysis Agent]
    DET -->|Image| IMG[Image Agent]
    DET -->|Goal| GOAL[Goal Planner Agent]
    DET -->|Automation| AUTO[Project Scanner + Planner]

    FILE --> RES
    REC --> RES
    RES --> LOGIC[Logic Agent]
    LOGIC --> RISK[Risk Agent]
    RISK --> STRAT[Strategy Agent]
    STRAT --> WRITE[Writing Agent]
    WRITE --> JUDGE[Judge Agent]
    JUDGE --> EVAL[Per-Agent Evaluation]
    EVAL --> EVO[Evolution Agent]
    EVO --> MEM[Memory Agent]
    MEM --> OUT[Final Response]

    IMG --> JUDGE
    GOAL --> OUT
    AUTO --> APPROVE[Approval Gate]
    APPROVE --> OUT
```

Specialist agents run in a pipeline: research → logic → risk → strategy → writing, then judge and evolution feedback, then memory. File, recording, image, goal, and automation tasks branch into the pipeline at the right point.

## 3. Governance Workflow Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    REQ[Incoming Request or Tool/Edit/Command] --> FIRE[Prompt Injection Firewall]
    FIRE --> SCAN[Secret Scanner]
    SCAN --> PERM[Permission System]
    PERM -->|read_only / plan_only| RUN[Execute or Plan]
    PERM -->|approve_to_edit / approve_to_run| QUEUE[Approval Queue]
    PERM -->|blocked| DENY[Blocked + Logged]
    QUEUE --> DECISION{Human Decision}
    DECISION -->|Approve| RUN
    DECISION -->|Reject| REJECT[Rejected + Audit Record]
    RUN --> LOG[Governance Log]
    DENY --> LOG
    REJECT --> LOG
```

Every risky action passes the prompt-injection firewall and secret scanner, then the permission system. Edit/run actions require human approval; blocked actions are denied. All decisions are written to the governance log with an audit trail.

## 4. Linear / Codex Workflow Diagram

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    L[Linear Issue moved to In Progress] --> POLL[Linear Poller]
    POLL --> BRANCH[Create linear/evo-* branch]
    BRANCH --> HANDOFF[Write handoff file in docs/linear-handoffs/]
    HANDOFF --> CODEX[Guarded Codex Worker Job]
    CODEX --> VERIFY[Run tests + frontend build]
    VERIFY -->|Pass| COMMENT[Post success comment to Linear]
    VERIFY -->|Fail| FAILCOMMENT[Post failure comment to Linear]
    COMMENT --> REVIEW[Issue ready for In Review]
    FAILCOMMENT --> REVIEW
```

The Linear/Codex worker is optional and server-side only. Keys live in `backend/.env` and are never exposed to the frontend. Full autonomous mode is disabled by default; verification (tests + build) gates every completion.

---

## 5. Workspace Memory Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    START[Run starts in active workspace] --> RETR[Retrieve relevant memory]
    RETR --> SCORE[Local sparse vector-style scoring]
    SCORE --> CAP[Cap context size]
    CAP --> USE[Inject capped memory into agents]
    USE --> RESP[Agents produce answer]
    RESP --> STORE[Store new memory entries]
    STORE --> TIER[Quality scoring + hot/warm/archived tiers]
    TIER --> IDX[Update local JSON vector index]
    IDX --> CONS[Consolidation jobs dedupe + archive]
```

Workspace memory is scoped per project. Before each run, a small capped set of high-value memories is retrieved using local semantic-style scoring. New results are scored, tiered, indexed, and periodically consolidated — all JSON-backed, with no external vector database.

---

## 6. Evaluation / Analytics Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    RUN[Completed Run] --> JUDGE[Judge Agent Scores]
    JUDGE --> PERAGENT[Per-Agent Usefulness + Clarity]
    PERAGENT --> ANALYTICS[Analytics Storage]
    ANALYTICS --> LEARN[Adaptive Learning Engine]
    LEARN --> PROMPTS[Prompt Versions + Workflow Strategy]
    LEARN --> ROUTING[Model Routing Suggestions]
    LEARN --> PREFS[User Preference Patterns]
    ANALYTICS --> LAB[AI Evaluation Lab]
    LAB --> BENCH[Benchmarks + A/B Tests + Regression Checks]
    BENCH --> REPORT[Evaluation + Learning Reports]
    PROMPTS --> APPROVAL[Approval-gated prompt changes]
```

Judge and per-agent scores feed analytics, which drives the Adaptive Learning Engine and the AI Evaluation Lab. The learning layer self-optimizes the orchestration layer — prompt versions, workflow strategy, model routing, and user preferences — and proposed prompt changes are approval-gated. The base LLM is never retrained.

---

## Safety Boundaries (Architecture-Level)

- No unrestricted shell execution — only an allowlist of build/test commands.
- No silent file edits — edits require explicit approval.
- Approval required for all risky (edit/run) actions.
- Secrets are redacted by the secret scanner.
- Prompt injection is checked by the firewall on every request.
- Governance logs are stored for every decision.
- The base LLM is not self-trained; only the orchestration layer self-optimizes.

## v41 — MCP Connector Hub

The MCP Connector Hub (`backend/app/services/mcp_connector_service.py`, routes under `/api/mcp`) follows the standard pattern: thin route → service → `StorageService` JSON (`mcp_connectors.json`, `mcp_connector_events.json`) → `GovernanceService` logging → Developer-Mode UI panel.

It maintains a local registry of MCP-style connectors with 9 default templates (Filesystem, Git, GitHub, Linear, Context7, Playwright, Slack, Notion, Desktop Commander). Connectors carry a risk level, a mode (read_only / approval_required / disabled), allowed/blocked action lists, and the *names* of required environment keys. Status checks are dry/mock and expose only booleans for env-key readiness — never values. Action planning enforces approval and risk rules and never executes real external/MCP calls in this version. Every stateful action is governance-logged and recorded as a connector event.

**Boundaries:** no real MCP execution by default, no secrets exposed to frontend/logs/API, no unrestricted shell, no full desktop control; high-risk connectors stay approval-required or disabled by default.

## v42 — MCP Execution Adapter

The MCP Execution Adapter (`backend/app/services/mcp_execution_service.py`, routes under `/api/mcp/executions` and `/api/mcp/connectors/{id}/execute`) layers a governed execution loop on top of the v41 planning service. It reuses `MCPConnectorService.plan_connector_action` for all risk/block/allow validation, then drives a request → approve → run → record state machine persisted in `mcp_execution_requests.json` and `mcp_execution_results.json`.

Read-only low-risk actions are auto-approved; every other action waits for explicit human approval; blocked or disabled connectors never produce a runnable request. Running an approved request re-validates the connector and then invokes a mock executor — `EXECUTION_MODE = "mock"` guarantees no real MCP server, network call, shell command, or device action, and no secrets are read or returned. Every step is governance-logged and surfaced in analytics.

## v43 — MCP Read-Only Adapter

The MCP Read-Only Adapter (`backend/app/services/mcp_readonly_adapter.py`) extends the v42 execution loop with the platform's first real tool-execution path — deliberately the safest possible one. `MCPExecutionService.run_execution` consults the adapter before falling back to the mock executor.

The adapter executes for real only when every condition holds: the `MCP_REAL_READONLY` env opt-in is set, the connector is enabled, the request is approved, and the action is on a fixed allow-list (`git_current_branch`, `git_list_branches`, `fs_list_directory`, `fs_file_metadata`). Git actions read `.git/HEAD` and `refs/heads` as plain files (no subprocess); filesystem actions return directory listings and file metadata (names and sizes only). It is standard-library only — no shell, no network, no writes/deletes, no secrets, and it never returns file contents. Every real path is sandboxed to the repo root with traversal + absolute-path blocking and a sensitive-name denylist, and `GET /api/mcp/adapter/status` reports the opt-in state, allow-list, and sandbox root. With the opt-in off (default), behaviour is identical to v42.
