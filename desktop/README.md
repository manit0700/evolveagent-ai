# EvolveAgent — native macOS app (Tauri)

Phase 5. Wraps the existing EvolveAgent web frontend in a native macOS window
using [Tauri v2](https://tauri.app) — a real app icon, a Mac-style overlay title
bar, and no browser tab. **Additive:** this lives entirely under `desktop/` and
does not change the web app or its CI. The web app keeps working exactly as
before; this is just a native shell around it.

## What it is (and isn't)

- **Is:** a thin, locked-down native window that loads the same React frontend
  (`frontend/dist` in release, the Vite dev server in development) and talks to
  your local backend at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. In desktop dev mode, the launcher
  starts FastAPI for you if that backend is not already running.
- **Isn't:** a new backend, a second copy of the UI, or anything with elevated
  privileges. It registers **no** shell, filesystem, or arbitrary-network
  capabilities (see `src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`). This keeps it aligned
  with EvolveAgent's safety model.

## Prerequisites (one-time, on your Mac)

Tauri compiles a native binary, so it needs a Rust toolchain and Apple's build
tools — these are **not** required for the web app.

```bash
xcode-select --install                                   # Xcode Command Line Tools
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh   # Rust
cd desktop && npm install                                # Tauri CLI + API
npm run tauri icon ../assets/logo.png                    # generate app icons (any square PNG ≥ 512px)
```

> Icons are generated locally into `src-tauri/icons/` (git-ignored so we never
> commit binaries). Point the command at any square logo; it produces every size
> Tauri needs, including the `.icns`.

## Run it

```bash
cd desktop
npm run dev      # starts backend if needed, then launches the native window
npm run build    # produces EvolveAgent.app + a .dmg in src-tauri/target/release/bundle/
```

`npm run dev` runs `scripts/dev-with-backend.mjs` through Tauri's
`beforeDevCommand`: it checks `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health`, starts
`uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000` from `backend/` when needed, then
starts the frontend dev server with `VITE_API_BASE` pointed at that backend.
`npm run build` still produces a frontend bundle only; a packaged app expects a
local backend to be running unless a future release adds a signed backend
sidecar.

If startup fails, run the backend directly once to see the Python error:

```bash
cd ../backend
source venv/bin/activate
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

If port `5173` is already in use, stop the old Vite process before rerunning
`npm run dev`; the desktop launcher uses a strict frontend port so Tauri always
opens the expected URL.

## Security posture

- **CSP** restricts the webview to `'self'`, the local backend
  (`http://127.0.0.1:8000` and its websocket), and the local Vite dev server
  (`localhost:5173` + HMR) — no external hosts. `script-src` includes
  `'unsafe-inline'` because Vite's dev-mode React-refresh preamble is injected
  inline; connect-src stays limited to localhost so nothing can be exfiltrated.
- **Capabilities** grant only `core:default`. No `shell`, `fs`, or `http`
  plugins are enabled, so the native layer cannot run commands, read/write
  arbitrary files, or reach arbitrary hosts.
- Add capabilities **explicitly and narrowly** if a future feature needs them;
  never widen to blanket access.
