## Automation Safety Checklist

- File edits require explicit approval.

- Destructive file deletion is not supported.
- Unrestricted shell execution is not supported.
- Package installation is not supported through automation.
- `.env` editing is blocked.
- `.git`, `node_modules/`, `venv/`, uploads, and local data/analytics files are blocked.
- Execute-level tools require approval.
- Prompt/workflow/model learning proposes changes only.
- Prompt versions require approval and can be rolled back.
- Custom agents cannot bypass permissions or governance.
- The app does not silently self-modify.
- The base LLM is not retrained or fine-tuned by the app.

## Files to Avoid Committing

- `.env`
- `backend/.env`
- `venv/`
- `node_modules/`

- `.pytest_cache/`
- `backend/app/uploads/`
- `backend/app/uploads/extracted/`
- `backend/app/data/*.json`
- local logs
- private uploaded documents
- private screenshots with secrets

## Environment Safety Checklist

- Confirm `.env` files are ignored.
- Do not commit API keys.
- Use `.env.example` or README examples for configuration.
- Keep `IMAGE_MODE=mock` unless real image support is intentionally added later.
- Use `TRANSCRIPTION_MODE=mock` for demos without transcription cost.
- Use `LLM_MODE=mock` for demos without API keys.
- Optional consensus keys are `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, and `MISTRAL_API_KEY`.
- Optional Linear/Codex worker keys stay server-side in `backend/.env`.
