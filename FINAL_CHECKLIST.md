# EvolveAgent AI — Final Checklist (current completed: v45.0 MCP Policy Engine · v44.5 Portfolio & Demo Pack)

EvolveAgent OS is a local-first, workspace-aware multi-agent AI platform with governed automation, plugins, analytics, evaluation, and portfolio management.

## v36–v40 checklist

- [x] **v36 — Innovation Lab:** research/competitors/trends/ideas/experiments/prototypes/reports; local-only; governance-logged.
- [x] **v37 — Simulation World:** worlds/personas/scenarios/run/compare/reports; deterministic mock; no real-world actions.
- [x] **v38 — Organization OS:** orgs/members/roles/permissions/workspace-links/activity; local records only, **no production auth**.
- [x] **v39 — Hardware Companion:** devices/settings/readiness/sessions; **no mic recording, no wake-word, no hardware access**.
- [x] **v40 — Operating Layer:** capability map / snapshots / recommendations / report / audit; **disclaimer visible (not AGI)**; safety boundaries surfaced.
- [x] **v41 — MCP Connector Hub:** connector registry / 9 default templates / risk levels / read-only vs approval-required modes / env-key readiness (booleans only) / dry status checks / action planning / governance + connector-event logs; **no real MCP execution, no secrets exposed, no unrestricted shell, no full desktop control**; high-risk connectors approval-required or disabled by default.
- [x] **v42 — MCP Execution Adapter:** request → approve → run → record loop / reuses v41 planning for validation / read-only low-risk auto-approved / writes require approval / **mock executor only (`EXECUTION_MODE = "mock"`, no real MCP/network/shell/device, no secrets)** / run-time re-validation / governance-logged / analytics.
- [x] **v43 — MCP Read-Only Adapter:** opt-in (`MCP_REAL_READONLY`) real read-only executor / allow-list (git_current_branch, git_list_branches, fs_list_directory, fs_file_metadata) / **stdlib only — no shell/network/writes/secrets, never returns file contents** / sandboxed to repo root with traversal + denylist / mock fallback when opt-in off / approval-gated / governance-logged; v42 mock behaviour unchanged by default.
- [x] **v44 — MCP Approvals Inbox:** unified prioritized queue of pending MCP approvals / enriched with connector name + risk + age / sorted high-risk & oldest first / risk filter / approve+reject **delegate to the governed execution service** (no new execution power) / analytics / MCP Hub panel section.
- [x] **v45 — MCP Policy Engine:** declarative **deny-only** policies evaluated before planning / match connector slug + action + risk with `*` wildcards + `except_actions` carve-out / **tighten-only (never grants access)** / wired into plan_connector_action / no-policy default is unchanged behavior / CRUD + evaluate + summary / governance-logged / analytics / MCP Hub Policies section.
- [x] Backend tests green and frontend build green after each version.
- [ ] PRs merged in order (v36 → v37 → v38 → v39 → v40 → v41 → v42 → v43 → v44) and verified on `main` before marking Linear Done.

## v44.5 — Portfolio & Demo Pack (consolidation)

- [x] Docs synced to real scale (44 versions · 85 services · ~480 routes · 48 test modules · 494 tests · ~10,200-line UI).
- [x] Portfolio pack created (`docs/PORTFOLIO_PACK.md`).
- [x] Screenshot guide refreshed with prioritized 12-shot pack (`screenshots/README.md`).
- [x] Demo script refreshed to a 5–7 minute, 9-scene flow (`docs/DEMO_VIDEO_SCRIPT.md`).
- [x] Release notes created (`docs/RELEASE_NOTES_v44.md`).
- [x] Demo-data checklist created (`docs/DEMO_DATA_CHECKLIST.md`).
- [x] `VERSIONS.md` includes a v44.5 entry + table row.
- [x] Backend tests pass (494) and frontend build passes.
- [x] No secrets committed.
- [x] No runtime data committed (`backend/app/data/*.json` remains git-ignored).
- [x] No backend/frontend behavior change — documentation only.

> **Not AGI.** Governed orchestration layer only. Roadmap after v40 is future-only.

## Current Roadmap Status

- **Completed and merged:** v21.0 — Multi-Modal Real-World Agent
- **Active work:** v22.0 — Industry Workflow Modes
- **Platform base:** v15.0 — EvolveAgent OS
- **Backend tests:** passing on completed release branches
- **Frontend build:** passing on completed release branches
- **Git status:** may include active v22 source work and local generated files; do not commit runtime data or secrets
- **Secrets/runtime data:** none committed; `.env` files and `backend/app/data/*.json` remain gitignored

### Release Readiness Checklist

- [x] README is final and professional (title, description, architecture, features, safety, tech stack, setup, status)
- [x] Architecture diagram added (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` + README + summary)
- [x] Screenshot guide exists (`screenshots/README.md`)
- [x] Demo video script exists (`docs/DEMO_VIDEO_SCRIPT.md`)
- [x] Resume bullets document exists (`docs/RESUME_BULLETS.md`)
- [x] Interview explanation document exists (`docs/INTERVIEW_EXPLANATION.md`)
- [x] Project case study exists (`docs/CASE_STUDY.md`)
- [x] GitHub repo is clean (gitignore covers env/uploads/runtime data/logs/build output)
- [x] Backend tests pass (222)
- [x] Frontend build passes
- [x] `.env.example` files present (`backend/.env.example`, `frontend/.env.example`)

### Known Limitations

- No authentication, cloud database, or deployment setup (intentionally local-first / MVP)
- No production vector database or RAG search — local JSON index only
- No OCR for scanned PDFs; no speaker diarization; no full video understanding
- No real image-generation API enabled by default (mock with fallback path)
- JSON storage is for MVP/demo scale, not distributed workloads
- Agent Jobs are local persisted records, not distributed workers

## Verification Commands

Backend tests:

```bash
cd backend
./venv/bin/pytest
```

Frontend build:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```
