# EvolveAgent AI Version History

EvolveAgent AI is a local-first, workspace-aware multi-agent AI operating system built with FastAPI + React, governed automation, JSON persistence, and a two-mode UI: Simple Mode and Developer Mode.

---

## Versioning Note

- This file documents the **implementation-track version map** — what actually shipped in code.
- The implementation track is **grounded in three concrete signals**: service docstrings (`backend/app/services/*.py`), the README checkpoint narrative, and the live API route groups (`backend/app/api/routes.py`).
- The repo also has a separate **official / vision roadmap track** used for planning (Linear milestone epics).
- **The planning-roadmap numbering may differ from this implementation-track numbering.** Where they diverge, the implementation track documented here is the source of truth.
- **Half-step checkpoints are preserved** — `v3.5`, `v7.5`, `v8.5`, `v11.5`, `v12.5`, and `v14.5` were real incremental polish/QA releases between the major numbered milestones and are listed as such.

## Project Scale

- **81** backend services
- **~456** API routes
- **44** service test modules
- **444** passing backend tests
- single-file React UI (~**10,000** lines)
- **44** implementation versions

## Architecture Pattern

Every feature follows the same governed path:

**Thin route → service → `StorageService` (JSON persistence) → `GovernanceService` logging → Simple Mode / Developer Mode UI.**

- **Thin route** (`backend/app/api/routes.py`) validates input via a Pydantic request model and delegates immediately.
- **Service** (`backend/app/services/<feature>_service.py`) holds all logic; no business logic lives in routes.
- **`StorageService`** persists every collection as local JSON — no external database.
- **`GovernanceService`** records every stateful action as a governance event (task type, agent, action, risk, approval/blocked state, reason).
- **Two-mode UI** — Simple Mode stays clean for end users; Developer Mode exposes a detailed panel per feature.

Each version is **additive**: it layers on top, removes no prior feature, and preserves existing API contracts.

## Safety Contract Across All Versions

Every version (from v2 onward) is built to the same contract:

- **Local-first** — all state lives on the local machine.
- **JSON persistence** — all persistent data goes through `StorageService`.
- **Mock / planning-first** — stateful and risky features draft, plan, or simulate by default rather than acting on the real world.
- **Permission-aware** — risky actions are gated behind approval and explicit permission profiles.
- **Governance-logged** — every stateful action is recorded as a governance event.
- **Simple Mode / Developer Mode** — clean for users, transparent for technical review.
- **Additive** — no feature removed; API contracts preserved.

Hard boundaries that always hold:

- **No unrestricted shell.**
- **No destructive autonomous file operations.**
- **No real sending/payment without approval.**
- **No production auth.**
- **Organization/team features are local records only.**
- **No real phone/hardware control.**
- **No mic recording or wake-word listener.**
- **No base-model self-training.**

> **v40 disclaimer:** This is not AGI. It is a governed orchestration layer across existing agents, workflows, tools, memory, simulations, and dashboards.

## Foundation Era — v1 to v14.5

The early era built the conversational core and the "Agent OS" beneath it, including several half-step checkpoints. A few intermediate integer versions (v4, v5, v7, v12) exist only on the planning/roadmap track and are intentionally not listed as separate implementation milestones.

### v1 — Base Conversational Agent
- **Purpose:** Original chat application — the spine everything else hangs off.
- **How it operates:** FastAPI + React; a ChatGPT-style UI calls a single `POST /api/run`. A Master Agent takes user input and returns a response. Chats and history are persisted as JSON.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/run`, `/api/chats`, `/api/history`.
- **Safety boundary:** Conversational only; no autonomous file or system actions.

### v2 — Safe Planning & Approval-Gated Automation
- **Purpose:** Establish the governed safety posture.
- **How it operates:** The agent **plans** actions rather than executing them; risky operations become *planned* steps requiring approval. Blocks destructive edits, package installation, and unrestricted shell. Adds browser voice-command transcription.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/run`, `/api/approvals`, `/api/transcription`.
- **Safety boundary:** No automatic file writes; destructive and shell operations blocked.

### v3 — Agent OS Foundation
- **Purpose:** The first operating-system layer beneath the UI.
- **How it operates:** Adds a **Project Brain** knowledge base (cross-session links + memory ranking), **Assistant Tools**, a governed **Tool Router** + local **plugin manifest loader**, **Approval Workflow 2.0**, **Agent Jobs**, a **System Prompt Registry**, and a thin **Kernel Service** around request orchestration.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/tools`, `/api/agent-jobs`, `/api/system-prompts`, `/api/plugins`, `/api/assistant`.
- **Safety boundary:** Tools run through a governed router; plugins load from local manifests only.

### v3.5 — UI/UX Polish
- **Purpose:** Professional presentation pass.
- **How it operates:** Jarvis-style Simple Mode command center, responsive Developer Mode sidebar, light/dark theme tokens, onboarding walkthrough, accessibility labels, reduced-motion handling.
- **Main API route groups:** (frontend-focused; no new API surface.)
- **Safety boundary:** Presentation only; no behavioral change.

### v6 — Memory Intelligence
- **Purpose:** Make workspace memory smart and self-maintaining.
- **How it operates:** Memories are scored, tiered, and indexed in a **local sparse vector-style index** (no external infrastructure), retrieved semantically, and **consolidated through tracked jobs**. Developer Mode surfaces quality reasons, retention actions, and tier history.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/memory`.
- **Safety boundary:** Local indexing only; no external vector database.

### v7.5 — Governed Tool Layer 2.0
- **Purpose:** Harden the tool subsystem.
- **How it operates:** Tool selections are stored as **execution history**, read-only runs carry success/quality metadata, plugin manifests get stricter validation. Tool internals stay hidden in Simple Mode.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/tools`.
- **Safety boundary:** Read-only tool runs metadata-tracked; stricter manifest validation.

### v8 / v8.5 — Demo Readiness & Provider QA
- **Purpose:** Make the platform demoable anywhere and verify providers safely.
- **How it operates:** v8 turns Simple Mode into a focused Speak/Type console while Developer Mode keeps the full workbench. v8.5 adds `/api/providers/status` reporting readiness, configured models, fallback info, and status messages via **safe dry checks** (no paid calls by default).
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/providers`.
- **Safety boundary:** Dry provider checks by default; no paid API calls without opt-in.

### v9 — Real Image API Path
- **Purpose:** First real paid-capability path (images).
- **How it operates:** `IMAGE_MODE=real` + `IMAGE_PROVIDER=openai` route image requests through OpenAI when configured, save generated images locally, and expose image-provider readiness checks — with **mock preview fallback** if the provider is unavailable.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/images`.
- **Safety boundary:** Opt-in real calls; mock fallback always available.

### v10 — Unified Real-API Control Layer
- **Purpose:** One control surface for all paid capabilities.
- **How it operates:** Unified readiness for **text, image, and transcription** via safe dry checks; real calls remain opt-in and every capability keeps mock fallback for local demos and tests.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/real-api`, `/api/transcription`, `/api/images`.
- **Safety boundary:** All real capabilities opt-in with mock fallback.

### v11 / v11.5 — Cost Control & Research Agent Foundation
- **Purpose:** Add cost visibility and a safe research capability.
- **How it operates:** v11 adds a Real-API Control panel with paid-capability readiness, dry-check defaults, live-call warnings, and cost-estimate guidance. v11.5 adds the **Autonomous Research Agent**: approval-gated research sessions, sources with **local credibility scores**, and claims linked to citations.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/real-api`, `/api/research`.
- **Safety boundary:** No unrestricted web browsing; research artifacts stored and evaluated locally.

### v12.5 — Digital Twin Work Style Engine
- **Purpose:** Model the user's working style/preferences.
- **How it operates:** Stores a local profile of work-style signals the agents reference when planning and responding.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/digital-twin`.
- **Safety boundary:** Local profile only; no external data sharing.

### v13 — Enterprise Governance & Compliance (early layer)
- **Purpose:** Strengthen governance and quality gates.
- **How it operates:** Expands governance logging and quality checks across requests, surfacing them in Developer Mode.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/quality`, `/api/governance`.
- **Safety boundary:** Governance-logged; quality-gated.

### v14 — Full AI Project Manager
- **Purpose:** Plan and track projects, tasks, and goals.
- **How it operates:** Manages projects with tasks and goals through structured records and dashboards.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/project-manager`, `/api/goals`.
- **Safety boundary:** Planning/tracking only; no autonomous execution.

### v14.5 — Portfolio Mode
- **Purpose:** Roll multiple projects into a portfolio view.
- **How it operates:** Aggregates project records into a portfolio dashboard with cross-project metrics.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/portfolio`.
- **Safety boundary:** Read/aggregate view; no autonomous changes.

- **Safety boundary:** No live app automation; drafts/plans only.

---

## v31 to v35 Series

### v31 — AI Team Lead / Manager Mode
- **Purpose:** Manage a team of agents/people as a lead.
- **How it operates:** **Team members** (with roles), **assignments** (work routed to members), **standups** (status capture), and **sprint review**; a dashboard rolls up workload and progress.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/team-manager`.
- **Safety boundary:** Planning/coordination only; governance-logged.

### v32 — Autonomous SaaS Builder
- **Purpose:** Planning/drafting studio for a SaaS product.
- **How it operates:** Drafts **projects**, **specs**, **scaffolding plans**, and **feedback items** — all drafts; no code deployment.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/saas-builder`, `/api/app-builder`.
- **Safety boundary:** Drafting only; no deployment or live build.

### v33 — AI Business Operator Advanced
- **Purpose:** Extend the v18 business layer with advanced operations.
- **How it operates:** A separate `/api/business-operator/*` surface adds operations **workflows** (lead_pipeline / support_triage / invoice_processing / custom with suggested next steps), **reports** (computes KPIs such as conversion rate and open cases), **KPI snapshots**, **approvals** (external_send / payment / high_risk / data_share), and an **audit** log. Reads v18 data read-only; does not duplicate it.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/business-operator`.
- **Safety boundary:** Draft-only — approving records a decision but performs no real send/payment/CRM action.

### v34 — Legal / Compliance Intelligence Layer
- **Purpose:** Compliance checklists, sensitive-data scanning, and contract review.
- **How it operates:** **Policies**; a **sensitive-data scanner** (reuses the existing SecretScanner plus PII/PHI patterns → risk level + HIPAA warning); **contract review** (flags indemnity / auto-renew / termination / governing-law, etc.); framework **checklists** (HIPAA / GDPR / SOC2 presets); and **audit packages** assembled from governance events and findings.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/compliance` (distinct from the pre-existing compliance admin routes).
- **Safety boundary:** Always labeled "not legal advice"; produces checklists/warnings/audit material for human review.

### v35 — AI Executive Board
- **Purpose:** Review decisions from multiple executive perspectives.
- **How it operates:** Create a **session** → generate a **review** from 8 roles (CEO / CTO / CFO / COO / Legal / Product / Marketing / Security) with risks/opportunities/costs/technical/compliance + a recommendation → cast role **votes** → produce a **report** with vote tally and board lean.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/executive-board`.
- **Safety boundary:** Advisory only — the board reviews and recommends; it does not execute actions.

---

## v36 to v40 Capstone Series

### v36 — Autonomous Research + Innovation Lab
- **Purpose:** Local R&D workbench for research, ideas, experiments, and prototypes.
- **How it operates:** **Research items** (source + credibility + tags), **competitors** (strengths/weaknesses), **trends** (direction + evidence), **idea scoring** (impact/feasibility/novelty/risk → composite `(I+F+N)×2 − risk×1.5`, sorted high-to-low), **experiment plans** (hypothesis/method/metrics), **prototype plans** (phases/features/risks), and **reports** (top-5 ideas + counts).
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/innovation-lab`.
- **Safety boundary:** Local/manual research only — no web browsing or external scraping.

### v37 — AI Simulation World
- **Purpose:** Safe sandbox to model decisions before acting.
- **How it operates:** Create a **world** → add **personas** (user/customer/stakeholder) → create a **scenario** (business/product/project/bug/risk/launch) → **run** it with **deterministic mock scoring** (base 60, +5 per assumption, −8 per risk keyword) yielding a likely result plus risks/opportunities/failure modes. **Compare** ranks scenarios by score; **reports** average outcomes.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/simulation-world`.
- **Safety boundary:** Deterministic mock simulation only — no real-world actions; same input → same score.

### v38 — Multi-User Organization OS
- **Purpose:** Local organization/team/workspace structure.
- **How it operates:** **Organizations**, **member profiles** (roles owner/admin/manager/contributor/viewer, each mapped to a default permission set), **member updates** (changing role re-derives permissions), **custom roles**, **workspace links**, and an **activity log**; the dashboard shows role distribution. Records are flagged as local (`is_local_record` / `is_local_profile`).
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/organization-os`.
- **Safety boundary:** Local organization records only — no production authentication or real user login.

### v39 — AI Hardware / Always-On Companion
- **Purpose:** Device-readiness and session-planning layer.
- **How it operates:** **Device profiles** (mic/speaker/local-processing flags), **companion-mode settings** (disabled / push_to_talk_ready / local_only_ready), **readiness checks** (checklist → ready/partial/not_ready), and **sessions** (always `user_activated`). The settings endpoint **locks safety invariants** — `background_listening`, `wake_word_listener`, and `microphone_recording` are forced `False` regardless of input.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/hardware-companion`.
- **Safety boundary:** Readiness/planning only — no mic recording, no wake-word listener, no hardware access; always requires explicit user activation.

### v40 — EvolveAgent Operating Layer
- **Purpose:** Capstone governed-orchestration dashboard across all systems (v15–v39).
- **How it operates:** A **capability map** of 10 groups (Platform / Organization / Business / Personal / Agents / Automation / Intelligence / Research / Compliance / Companion), each marked active by whether its data exists; **readiness snapshots** (% of active groups + governance/blocked counts); cross-system **recommendations**; **safety boundaries**; a **final report**; and an **audit** trail.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/operating-layer`.
- **Safety boundary / disclaimer:**

  > This is not AGI. It is a governed orchestration layer across existing agents, workflows, tools, memory, simulations, and dashboards.

### v41 — MCP Connector Hub
- **Purpose:** Register, configure, inspect, and safely **plan** tool connections through MCP-style connector records.
- **How it operates:** A local **connector registry** with 9 default templates (Filesystem, Git, GitHub, Linear, Context7, Playwright, Slack, Notion, Desktop Commander). Each connector has a **category**, **risk level** (low/medium/high), **mode** (read_only / approval_required / disabled), allowed/blocked actions, and required env-key *names*. **Status checks are dry/mock** and report only whether required env keys are set (true/false) — never their values. **Action planning** enforces risk/approval rules: read-only low-risk actions are auto-allowed; everything else requires approval; blocked-list and not-in-allow-list actions are refused. Every stateful action is governance-logged and recorded as a connector event. The Master Agent lightly classifies MCP/tool-connection queries (`mcp_connector_management`); analytics and a learning hook surface connector counts, planned/blocked actions, and recommendations.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/mcp`.
- **Safety boundary:** The EvolveAgent MCP Connector Hub prepares and governs tool connections through local connector records, dry checks, approval boundaries, and audit logs. **No real MCP execution by default, no secrets exposed, no unrestricted shell, no full desktop control.** High-risk connectors (Filesystem, Playwright, Desktop Commander) stay approval-required or disabled by default.

### v42 — MCP Execution Adapter
- **Purpose:** Add a governed execution loop on top of the v41 connector planning layer.
- **How it operates:** A **request → approve → run → record** flow. `request_execution` reuses the v41 `plan_connector_action` rules to validate (blocked-list, allow-list, risk/approval): blocked actions create a non-runnable `blocked` request; read-only low-risk actions are auto-`approved`; everything else stays `pending_approval`. Approving moves a request to `approved`; running it invokes a **mock executor** that returns a simulated result and records it. Running re-validates the connector (a since-disabled connector is blocked at run time). Stored under `mcp_execution_requests.json` / `mcp_execution_results.json`; every step is governance-logged and reflected in analytics.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/mcp/executions`, `/api/mcp/connectors/{id}/execute`.
- **Safety boundary:** Execution is always simulated (`EXECUTION_MODE = "mock"`) — **no real MCP server, network call, shell command, or device action, and no secrets used or returned**. Write actions always require explicit approval; blocked/disabled connectors never execute.

### v43 — MCP Read-Only Adapter
- **Purpose:** Add a real, opt-in, read-only execution path to the v42 loop — the project's first genuinely real tool execution, kept strictly safe.
- **How it operates:** A sandboxed adapter (`mcp_readonly_adapter.py`) that the execution service consults during `run_execution`. It executes for real **only when all hold**: env opt-in `MCP_REAL_READONLY` is set, the connector is enabled, the request is approved, and the action is on the allow-list (`git_current_branch`, `git_list_branches`, `fs_list_directory`, `fs_file_metadata`). Git actions read `.git/HEAD` and `refs/heads` as plain files (no subprocess); filesystem actions return directory listings / file metadata (names and sizes only, never contents). Anything else falls back to the v42 mock. `GET /api/mcp/adapter/status` exposes the opt-in state, allow-list, and sandbox root.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/mcp/adapter/status` (plus the v42 execution routes).
- **Safety boundary:** **Standard-library only — no shell/subprocess, no network, no writes/deletes, no secrets, and never returns file contents.** Sandboxed to the repo root with traversal + absolute-path blocking and a sensitive-name denylist (`.env`, keys, `.ssh`, `.git/config`, …); dotfiles and sensitive names are hidden from listings. Opt-in defaults off, so default behaviour is identical to v42 (mock).

### v44 — MCP Approvals Inbox
- **Purpose:** A single, prioritized place to review and act on everything on the MCP surface awaiting human approval.
- **How it operates:** Aggregates the v42 execution requests in `pending_approval` status, enriches each with connector name, risk level, and age, and sorts them **high-risk first, then oldest first** (with a risk-level filter). Approve/reject **delegate to `MCPExecutionService`** (which does the governance logging and status transitions), so the inbox holds no independent execution power. Derives entirely from existing execution state — no new storage.
- **Main API route groups:** `/api/mcp/inbox` (+ `/summary`, `/{item_id}/approve`, `/{item_id}/reject`).
- **Safety boundary:** Read/triage + delegated decisions only — it can approve or reject an existing pending request but adds no new action, execution, or bypass; all decisions flow through the governed execution service and are logged.
